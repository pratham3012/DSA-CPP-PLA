- Treasure Hunterer
```
Though there have been more successful pirates, Blackbeard is one of the best-known and widely-feared of his time. He commanded four ships and had a pirate army of 300 at the height of his career and defeated the famous warship, HMS “Scarborough” in sea-battle. He was known for barreling into battle clutching two swords with several knives and pistols at the ready. He captured over forty merchant ships in the Caribbean and without flinching killed many prisoners. Now, Blackbeard 
Blackbeard and his three pirates found a treasure of gold coins. Long Ben too joined them. They decided to share the treasure. Blackbeard agreed to give x% share for Long Ben. He then decided to take y% share from the remaining treasure. His other pirates will share the remaining gold coins equally. Write a program to compute their share's.

INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 3 integers.

The first input corresponds to the number of gold coins in the treasure.

The second input corresponds to Ben'
The second input corresponds to Ben's share percentage and the last input is Blackbeard's share percentage.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The output consists of three integers.

The first output integer corresponds to Long Ben's share.

The second integer corresponds to Blackbeard's share.

The last integer corresponds to other pirates share.

- Array Insertion
```
Arun and Ram were playing cards. Arun has 5 cards. Ram wants to insert a new card in between Arun's cards. Ram wants to find the position to insert the card. So help him to find the position to insert a certain card. If Ram inserts a card in a position other than the position of 5 cards, the game will be over. So play carefully. EXAMPLE: consider an array having three elements in it initially and a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2 and a[2] = 3 and you want to insert a number 45 at location 1 i.e
i.e. a[0] = 45, so we have to move elements one step below after insertion a[1] = 1 , and a[2] = 2 and a[3] = 3.
Input Format:

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.
Sample Input:

- Maximum Element In Each Row
```There are some students in the class. The class Adviser needs a recruitment's process for above 60% students. In each and every row there was a student above 60% . Help your adviser to find the students in each row.


Input Format:

The input consists of (m*n+2) integers. The first integer corresponds to m, the number of rows in the matrix and the second integer corresponds to n, the number of columns in the matrix. The remaining integers correspond to the elements in
The elements are read in row wise order, first row first, then second row and so on. Assume that the maximum value of m and n is 10.

- Upper Triangular Matrix
```
An upper triangular matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements below the diagonal are zero. That is, all the non-zero elements are in the upper triangle: Write a JAVA program to find whether a given matrix is an upper triangular matrix or not.
Input Format:

The input consists of (n*n+1) integers. The first integer corresponds to the number of rows/columns in the matrix. The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix. The elements are read in rowwise order, first row first, then second row and so on. Assume that the maximum value of m and n is 5.

 

Output Format:

Print "yes" if it is an upper triangular matrix . Print "no" if it is not an upper triangular matrix.

 
Sample Input 1:

2

1 2

0 3

 

Sample Output 1:

yes```
